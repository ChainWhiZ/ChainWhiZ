# ChainWhiZ 
We are building an Open source and Decentralised Marketplace for Dapp development (blockchain applications).
## Web Repo
It is the front end application of ChainWhiZ built using ReactJS

### What is ChainWhiZ?
We are building an Open source and Decentralised Marketplace for Dapp development with zero platform fees. Anyone on the platform can post a bounty for building out a dapp with a reward amount(in crypto) associated with it. Anybody interested to take up the bounty and build the entire dapp will have to submit a technical plan before writing any lines of code. So, who chooses which technical plan is the best? This is where the community comes into play. Since the future of the web namely Web3.0 is highly community-centric, our platform gives the entire community the power to stake our native tokens and cast votes on the technical plans submitted on the bounty in exchange for token rewards. The individual whose technical plan receives the highest number of votes will get the chance to develop and build the entire dapp. With the very power of this voting system in the community, our vision is to make it possible for anyone with or without a coding background to get a dapp created easily.

### Functionality
* Login using github account.
* Post a bounty
* Post a workplan for the bounty
* Solve for any workplan of the bounty and win the bounty if selected.
* Vote on any solutions by staking CW tokens and win rewards, if the solution gets the highest score.
